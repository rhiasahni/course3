  std() - Standard deviation
  meanFreq() - Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
  
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

  gravityMean
  tBodyAccMean
  tBodyAccJerkMean
  tBodyGyroMean
  tBodyGyroJerkMean
